# Overview

Render tables with basic math functions using data from your blocks.

Just use the slash command `/table render` to get started!

If you do not want the summary table (with the sum, average and median), you can add "nosum" as a flag.

By default, each block will be a column in the table. Add the "rows" flag to change this behavior so that each block becomes a row, and nested blocks become columns.
